# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/introduction-artificial-intelligence-java-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474016), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Using Java aims to demonstrate how to build AI Applications using Java. Starting out with search algorithms, game playing and knowledge-based systems, it’ll quickly dive into setting up with necessary tools required to program these techniques.
Next, we shall build upon machine learning applications using Weka. We shall work with datasets by converting their formats, training and evaluation of classifiers, saving and loading classifiers. Next, we shall be working with training clusters and evaluating them.  Next we shall develop and predict semi-supervised models.
